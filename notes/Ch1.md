# The Role of algorithms in computing
**Algorithms**: sequence of computational procedures takes some values and produce value or set of values.
**Input ( instance ) of the problem**: is anything needed to compute solution of the problem.
## choosing best algorithm is dependent on:
1. the number of items to be sorted
2. the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted
3. possible restrictions on the item values
4. the architecture of the computer
5. the kind of storage devices to be used: main memory, disks, or even tapes.
## kinds of problems that can be solved with algorithm:
## Data Structure
a way to store and organize data to facilitate access and modification.
## why is NP-complete problems are interesting?
1. because there isn't efficient algorith for it.
2. NP problems has remarkable proberty that if an algorithm exist for any of them , then this algorithm will exist for all of them. 
3. NP-complete problems are similar ,but not identical, to other problems which we find an efficient algorithm for.
## Effeciency 
different algorithms designed to solve the same problem may differ dramaticaly in thier effiecincy. we will see in the comming chapter merge sort and insertion sort which are designed to solve the same problem are different widely.
## Notes
1. Our measure of efficiency is speed.
2. If the speed of computer is infinite and the storage is free, you will still need the algorithm to demonstrate that ur solution will terminate and with correct answer.
