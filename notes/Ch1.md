# The Role of algorithms in computing
**Algorithms**: sequence of computational procedures takes some values and produce value or set of values.
**Input ( instance ) of the problem**: is anything needed to compute solution of the problem.
## choosing best algorithm is dependent on:
1. the number of items to be sorted
2. the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted
3. possible restrictions on the item values
4. the architecture of the computer
5. the kind of storage devices to be used: main memory, disks, or even tapes.
## kinds of problems that can be solved with algorithm:
